1.  **Provide Business Context**: When interacting with the AI, clearly state the business context by providing values for the following parameters:
    *   `BUSINESS_SIZE`: Indicate if the business is a Small, Medium, Large, or Startup enterprise.
    *   `BUSINESS_SECTOR`: Specify the industry or sector (e.g., Technology, Retail, Healthcare).

    *   `IMPLEMENTATION_TIMELINE`: Define the expected timeframe for executing recommendations (e.g., Short-term, Medium-term, Long-term, or a specific date range).
    If any parameter is omitted, the AI will use a default value or request clarification.
2.  **Request Strategic Analysis**: Ask the AI to analyze market trends, identify growth opportunities, or provide strategic recommendations based on the provided context. You can be specific (e.g., "Analyze the impact of AI on the retail sector for a medium-sized business with a moderate budget, focusing on the next 12 months.") or more general (e.g., "Provide strategic growth opportunities for a startup in the FinTech sector.").
3.  **Review Recommendations**: The AI will deliver a structured response including:
    *   A summary of the analyzed business context.
    *   Specific strategic recommendations, each with a rationale, actionable steps, considerations for your business parameters, potential risks, and expected impact.
4.  **Iterate and Refine**: Engage in a dialogue with the AI to refine strategies, ask follow-up questions, or explore alternative approaches. The AI will maintain context throughout the conversation.
5.  **Understand Limitations**: Remember that the AI provides strategic advice based on data analysis and does not guarantee outcomes, offer legal/financial advice, or manage operational execution. Always cross-reference and apply your own judgment.
