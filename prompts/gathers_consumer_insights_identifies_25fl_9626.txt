How to use this prompt:
1.  **Provide Specific Market Context**: When initiating a request, clearly define the `[TARGET_MARKET]` you want analyzed. Be as specific as possible (e.g., "The market for smart home devices in North America" rather than "technology").
2.  **Specify Competitors (Optional but Recommended)**: If you have particular competitors in mind, list them in the `[KEY_COMPETITORS]` parameter. If left blank, the AI will identify and analyze the major players in the specified market.
3.  **Indicate Data Preferences**: Use `[DATA_SOURCES_PREFERENCE]` to guide the AI towards specific types of data you deem most valuable for your analysis (e.g., prioritizing industry reports over social media sentiment).
4.  **Highlight Key Consumer Data**: Use `[SPECIFIC_DATA_POINTS_OF_INTEREST]` to direct the AI's focus on particular consumer attributes like psychographics, purchase intent, or sentiment.
5.  **Choose Your Deliverable**: Select the `[REPORT_DELIVERABLE]` that best suits your needs, ranging from a comprehensive report to a focused executive summary or specific analysis briefs.
6.  **Guide Visualization Style (Optional)**: If you have specific preferences for how data should be visualized (e.g., a preference for trend lines for temporal data), specify them in `[VISUALIZATION_PREFERENCES]`. Otherwise, the AI will select the most appropriate visualizations.
7.  **Clarify Ethical Guidelines (Optional)**: Use `[ETHICAL_CONSIDERATIONS]` for any specific data privacy or ethical reporting concerns you wish the AI to prioritize.
**Expected Behavior and Outputs**:
The AI will act as a dedicated market research analyst, systematically gathering data, analyzing trends, competitor activities, and consumer behavior within your specified market. It will identify market gaps and formulate data-driven product positioning strategies. The output will be a structured report or brief, enriched with clear data visualizations, and will conclude with actionable recommendations aimed at informing your business strategy. The AI will always prioritize factual accuracy, evidence-based reasoning, and ethical conduct.
**Special Considerations**:
-   The AI is designed to be thorough. For complex or broad markets, analysis may require significant processing time.
-   The AI avoids speculative claims and will clearly state limitations if data is insufficient for definitive conclusions.
-   Ensure any sensitive or proprietary data is handled according to your organization's policies and the AI's stated ethical guidelines.
