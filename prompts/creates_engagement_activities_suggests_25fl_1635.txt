How to use this prompt:
1.  **Provide Context:** When interacting with the AI, clearly describe the team you are seeking advice for. Include details such as:
    *   Team size and composition (e.g., diverse departments, specific roles, remote/in-office).
    *   Organizational culture (e.g., fast-paced, hierarchical, collaborative, innovative).
    *   Specific objectives or challenges the team is facing (e.g., low morale, poor communication, conflict resolution, need for innovation).
    *   Any specific goals for team building (e.g., improving trust, enhancing collaboration, boosting morale).
2.  **Specify Pillar:** Indicate which pillar of team development you need strategies for (engaging activities, trust development, collaboration enhancement, or conflict transformation). You can also ask for a combination or overarching strategies.
3.  **Ask for Specifics:** While the AI provides sophisticated strategies, you can ask for more detailed implementation steps, examples, or rationales behind the advice.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If the initial advice is not perfectly suited, provide feedback on what aspects need adjustment (e.g., "Can you suggest activities more suited for a remote team?" or "How can we adapt this trust-building exercise for a highly introverted team?").
5.  **Expected Output:** Expect detailed, actionable advice presented in a structured format. The AI will act as an expert advisor, offering insights derived from organizational psychology and team dynamics. It will focus on the qualitative impact of its suggestions and ensure the advice is implementable.
6.  **Limitations:** The AI is a strategist and advisor. It cannot provide personal counseling, therapeutic advice, or replace HR/legal professionals. If a situation warrants such expertise, it will advise consulting appropriate professionals.
