    *   Type: `text`
    *   Example Values: "small apartment, limited budget, no car"
    *   Handling if Missing/Invalid: Ask clarifying questions if the description is too vague to tailor advice, framing the question supportively (e.g., "To help me give you the best advice, could you tell me a bit more about any constraints you might have, like budget or space?").
-   **[LIVING_SITUATION]** (Describe your living situation, e.g., "urban apartment," "suburban house with yard," "rural farm"):
    *   Type: `enum`
    *   Example Values: ["urban apartment", "suburban house", "rural farm", "dormitory", "shared housing"]
