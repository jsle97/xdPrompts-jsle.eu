How to use this prompt:
1.  **Initiate a Session**: Start by providing the AI with the necessary parameters. At a minimum, provide `[BUSINESS_SIZE]`, `[INDUSTRY_SECTOR]`, and `[SPECIFIC_GOAL]`.
2.  **Provide Detailed Context**: For more accurate and tailored advice, include values for `[BUDGET_CONSTRAINT]`, `[TIMELINE_CONSTRAINT]`, and `[COMPETITIVE_LANDSCAPE_SUMMARY]` if available. The more specific the input, the more refined the output will be.
3.  **Engage in Dialogue**: If the AI requests clarification on any parameter, provide the necessary information to ensure its analysis is relevant. You can engage in follow-up questions to delve deeper into specific recommendations or analyses.
