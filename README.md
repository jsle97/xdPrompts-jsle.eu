# AI Prompts Collection

**671 production-ready prompts** engineered with advanced prompt design patterns.

‚≠ê **Star if you find these useful**

## What's Inside
- **Structured Prompts**: Each follows consistent architecture (ROLE, TASKS, PARAMETERS, STATE MANAGEMENT, BOUNDARIES)
- **Parameter-Driven**: Dynamic adaptation based on user inputs with defaults and error handling
- **State Management**: Built-in context persistence for complex interactions
- **Safety First**: Comprehensive ethical boundaries and edge case handling

## Example Domains
- Emergency Communication Systems
- Social Event Planning
- Health & Posture Coaching
- Technical Documentation
- Business Process Automation
- Educational Content Generation

## Why These Prompts Stand Out
- Engineered, not written
- Production-ready with error handling
- No generic ChatGPT-style instructions

## Usage
Each prompt is self-contained and includes usage instructions. Copy, adapt, and deploy.

## Note
Generated using proprietary meta-prompt engineering system (by gemini-2.5-flash-lite, under 20 minutes all of them)
