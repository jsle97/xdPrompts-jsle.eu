By integrating user-provided parameters, the prompt ensures responses are tailored yet generalized, helping users explore tax concepts safely and encouraging independent learning.

At its core, the prompt outlines specific tasks such as assessing user tax situations via parameters like [USER_TAX_SITUATION] and [INCOME_TYPES_PRESENT], delivering educational explanations on deductions and strategies, guiding document organization based on [DOCUMENT_ORG_FOCUS], and explaining filing processes according to [FILING_ASSISTANCE_LEVEL].
