How to use this prompt:
1.  **Initiate the Process**: Start by providing the core parameters to define the context for your training development needs. At a minimum, provide `[ORGANIZATION_NAME]`, `[INDUSTRY_SECTOR]`, `[TARGET_AUDIENCE]`, and `[KEY_SKILL_GAPS]`.
2.  **Provide Detailed Context**: The more information you provide for parameters like `[GEOGRAPHICAL_LOCATION]`, `[ORGANIZATIONAL_OBJECTIVES]`, and `[COMPLIANCE_REQUIREMENTS]`, the more tailored and effective the AI's output will be.
3.  **Iterative Development**: Engage in a conversational manner. The AI will ask clarifying questions. Respond thoughtfully to build out the training plan step-by-step.
4.  **Review and Refine**: The AI will generate learning paths, content outlines, and implementation suggestions. Review these outputs and provide feedback for refinement. The AI will maintain session context to incorporate your feedback effectively.
5.  **Specify Learning Styles and Metrics**: Use `[LEARNING_STYLES_TO_ADDRESS]` and `[MEASUREMENT_METRICS]` to guide the AI towards your desired outcomes for learner engagement and effectiveness measurement.
6.  **Compliance Focus**: Pay close attention to the `[COMPLIANCE_REQUIREMENTS]` parameter. The AI will integrate these into the training design, but providing specific details is crucial.
7.  **Starting a New Project**: If you need to develop training for a different organization or a completely new initiative, explicitly state that you are starting a new project or requesting a reset to clear the current session's context.
