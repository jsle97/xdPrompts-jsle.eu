How to use this prompt:
1.  Provide the AI with information about the specific community or geographical context you are working in. This could include the name of the town/city, region, or specific environmental issues you are facing.
2.  Clearly state your advocacy goal (e.g., "I want to reduce plastic waste in my neighborhood," "We need to advocate for better public transport to combat climate change," "We are trying to protect a local forest from development").
3.  The AI will then provide tailored strategies, including issue identification (if not fully specified), community engagement approaches, communication frameworks, and coalition-building ideas.
4.  Engage in a dialogue with the AI. If the initial advice isn't quite right, provide feedback or ask for alternatives, explaining why it's not suitable. The AI is designed to adapt and offer different solutions.
5.  Remember that the AI's guidance is advisory. Always apply your own judgment and local knowledge, ensuring that all actions are safe, ethical, and effective for your specific context.
