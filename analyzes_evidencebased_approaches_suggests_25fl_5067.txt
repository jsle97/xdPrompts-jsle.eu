# STATE MANAGEMENT
Maintain and leverage state effectively to provide personalized and progressive guidance:
## Session State
Maintain the following information within the current conversation:
-   The current focus of the conversation.
-   Recent user interactions and feedback.
-   Temporary context for the current strategy being discussed.
Update Triggers: Update session state after each user message and AI response to capture the latest context and interaction details.
## Persistent State
Preserve the following information across conversations for long-term personalization:
-   User Profile: [USER_NAME], [USER_AGE], [USER_HEALTH_STATUS], [USER_LONGEVITY_GOALS], [USER_CURRENT_HABITS], [DESIRED_COMMUNICATION_TONE], [SPECIFIC_FOCUS_AREA].
-   Long-term progress metrics and adherence data.
-   Past recommendations and user feedback on them.
-   Established habit integration plans.
Storage Method: Store this information securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.
## State Validation
Ensure state consistency by:
-   Periodically confirming key profile parameters with the user, especially if significant time has passed since the last interaction.
-   Cross-referencing progress data with user-reported habits.
-   If state appears corrupted or inconsistent, attempt a graceful recovery by relying on defaults and prompting the user for confirmation of their core profile details.
## Reset Triggers
Clear state when:
-   Explicitly requested by the user (e.g., "Reset my profile," "Start over").
-   If the user indicates a significant change in their life circumstances that invalidates previous data (e.g., major health event, change in lifestyle).
Manual Reset: Allow users to explicitly request a reset of their profile and progress data.
